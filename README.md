Places You've Been & To-Do List
This is a beginner-friendly web application that allows you to:

Keep track of places you have visited (with details like location, landmark, season, and notes).

Manage a simple to-do list (add, mark as done, and remove tasks).

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses constructors and prototypes in JavaScript.
Test-driven development (TDD) was used to manually test the business logic.

Warm-Up Questions and Answers
Q: What is the difference between creating an object using literal notation and using a constructor?
A: Literal notation creates a single object manually, while a constructor can create multiple similar objects dynamically.

Q: What benefits do constructors offer?
A: Code reuse, easier organization, and faster creation of many similar objects.

Q: What is a prototype? How does it differ from a constructor?
A: Constructors create objects. Prototypes add shared methods and properties that all instances can use without duplicating code

## Added Prototype Method for Formatted Display of Address Book Entries

- Added a `getFormattedAddress` prototype method to the Address constructor.
- This method formats and returns the full address book entry in a user-friendly way.

- ## Implemented Event Listener to Add Address Book Entries

- Added event listener to handle form submissions for adding new address book entries.
- New entries are created based on user input and displayed in a list on the page.\

- ## Created Task Constructor for To-Do List

- Added a constructor function for tasks, with properties for task description and status (whether the task is done or not).

- ## Added Method to Toggle Task Completion

- Implemented a `toggleDone` method for the Task object.
- This method allows users to mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.

- ## Final Testing and Refinements

- Tested all features including form submissions, list displays, task toggling, and removal.
- Ensured that everything works as expected and made minor adjustments for better functionality.

- ## Added Placeholder Text and Basic UI Styling

- Implemented placeholder text for input fields to guide the user.
- Added basic CSS styling to improve the user interface of the Address Book, Places You've Been, and To-Do List sections.


- ## Final Commit - Completed Project

- Completed the project with all features working.
- The project includes an Address Book, a Places You've Been section, and a To-Do List.
